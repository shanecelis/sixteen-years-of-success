> A man from Mudjimba Beach, Queensland, Australia, named Les Stewart had a similar desire. He stumbled upon a bizarre idea. He typed the numbers to one million in words and spent 16 years doing it. It sounds shocking but it is true. He started to type the numbers in 1982 with a typewriter and completed his record on December 7, 1998. It took him 19,990 quarto sheets and 1000 ink ribbons as well to complete this record. Guinness World Records tweeted a photo of Les and a picture of the numbers he had typed on January 10, 2022. Piles of many sheets in which he had typed the numbers are placed opposite Les. 

This is dedicated to Les Stewart [the man who spent 16
years]() writing
out the numbers from one to one million in English.
